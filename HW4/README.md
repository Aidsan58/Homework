This chapter uses the class rectangleType to illustrate how to overload the operators +, *, ==, !=, >>, and <<. In this exercise, first redefine the
class rectangleType by declaring the instance variables as protected
and then overload additional operators as defined in parts a to c.
a. Overload the pre- and post-increment and decrement operators to
increment and decrement, respectively, the length and width of a
rectangle by one unit. (Note that after decrementing the length and
width, they must be positive.)
b. Overload the binary operator - to subtract the dimensions of one
rectangle from the corresponding dimensions of another rectangle.
If the resulting dimensions are not positive, output an appropriate
message and do not perform the operation.
c. The operators == and != are overloaded by considering the lengths
and widths of rectangles. Redefine the functions to overload the
relational operator by considering the areas of rectangles as follows:
Two rectangles are the same, if they have the same area; otherwise, the
rectangles are not the same. Similarly, rectangle yard1 is greater than
rectangle yard2 if the area of yard1 is greater than the area of yard2.
Overload the remaining relational operators using similar definitions.
d. Write the definitions of the functions to overload the operators
defined in parts a to c.
e. Write a test program that tests various operations on the class
rectangleType.
