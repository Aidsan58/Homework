Write a program that creates three identical lists, list1, list2, and list3,
of 5000 elements. The program then sorts list1 using quick sort, list2
using insertion sort, and list3 using merge sort and outputs the number
of comparisons and item assignments made by quick sort and insertion
sort and the number of comparisons made by merge sort.
