(DVD Store Program) In Programming Exercise 14 in Chapter 16,
you were asked to design and implement a class to maintain customer
data in a linked list. Because the search on a linked list is sequential
and, therefore, can be time-consuming, design and implement the
class customerBTreeType so that this customer data can be stored
in a binary search tree. The class customerBTreeType must be
derived from the class bSearchTreeType, as designed in this chapter. (To output the number of DVDs rented by a customer, write the
definition of the function nodeCount, as in Programming Exercise 1,
of the class binaryTreeType.)

12. (DVD Store Program) Using classes to implement the DVD data,
DVD list data, customer data, and customer list data, as designed
in this chapter and in Programming Exercise 11, design and complete the program to put the DVD store into operation. (To output
the number of DVDs rented by a customer, write the definition of
the function nodeCount, as in Programming Exercise 1, of the class
binaryTreeType.)
