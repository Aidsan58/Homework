Data Structures and Algorithms - Final Project
Project Title: The "Smart Dictionary & Spell Checker" System
I. Project Goal
The objective of this final project is to design, implement, and analyze a highly efficient text-processing system. Your application will load a massive dictionary file and provide rapid functionalities for spell-checking and word suggestions, utilizing specialized tree structures and hashing techniques.
II. Core Requirements
You must implement a command-line application that reads a dictionary file, builds optimized data structures for storage, and provides specific text analysis functions.
A. Data Structures
Trie (Prefix Tree): Implement a Trie data structure to store the entire dictionary. This structure is essential for enabling efficient prefix-based searching and auto-completion.
Hash Table/Hash Set: Implement a Hash Table (or use a built-in HashSet if your language allows basic container use, verify with instructor) to perform immediate O(1) average time lookups for the spell checker functionality.
B. Algorithms
Trie Insertion/Search: Efficient algorithms for adding words to the Trie and traversing the tree to find all words matching a given prefix.
Hashing Algorithm: An effective hashing mechanism for quick data storage and retrieval in your hash table.
Heap Sort (or a Priority Queue use): Use a Max-Heap to sort the suggested words generated by the Trie functionality based on frequency or alphabetical order (see suggestions below).
C. Functionality
Your system must support the following user commands via the command line interface:
LOAD [filename]: Load dictionary data from a specified text file (see Section III) into both the Trie and the Hash Table.
CHECK [word]: Perform a spell check. Print "✅ [word] is spelled correctly." or "❌ [word] is misspelled." using the Hash Table lookup.
SUGGEST [prefix]: Use the Trie to find and print up to 5 suggested words that start with the given prefix.
HELP: Display a list of available commands.
EXIT: Terminate the program.
III. Input Data Format
The system should accept a single plain text file (e.g., dictionary.txt), where each line contains one dictionary word.
Example dictionary.txt:
apple
apply
application
banana
band
bandit
car
card
IV. Deliverables
Submit the following items packaged in a single ZIP file via the course management system:
Source Code: All source files required to compile and run your program.
README.txt: A plain text file containing:
Your name and student ID.
Instructions on how to compile and run your program.
A description of your chosen implementation details (e.g., "I used a Trie where each node stores a hash map of children pointers, and a custom Hash Table with separate chaining.").
ANALYSIS.pdf: A short (1-2 page) report that provides a Big O time complexity analysis for your implementations of:
Loading the dictionary data.
The CHECK functionality (Hash Table lookup).
The SUGGEST functionality (Trie traversal)
